(tdr) rollexus, check the pdf flag is enabled for it
(rollexus) tdr: I got you. will give it a shot
(rollexus) tdr: pdf flag?
(rollexus) Ahhh yes the "USE
(rollexus) "
(tdr) rollexus, on okular, pdf support is optional
(rollexus) should have pdf?
(rollexus) Got it
(tdr) rollexus, okular was one of my fav kde apps
(rollexus) Cool
(rollexus) so add pdf to my use before installing?
(tdr) rollexus, if emerge -vp okular shows -pdf then yes
(NewbieG) I am completely new to Gentoo. I am trying install it
(rollexus) cool
(tdr) NewbieG, you have the handbook right?
(rollexus) tdr: It should show -pdf? Meaning don't include PDF?
** mystified has joined #gentoo
(tdr) rollexus, you want that to be "pdf" not "-pdf"
(tdr) so either package.use or global enable pdf flag
(rollexus) tdr: Got it
(NewbieG) Do I need to create the bios boot partition which is of size 1-2mb
(NewbieG) Is this mandatory
(tdr) NewbieG, does your box do real efi booting?
(NewbieG) No
(tdr) NewbieG, using mbr?
(NewbieG) tdr, yes i am using mbr
(tdr) NewbieG, if you use bios + mbr you shouldnt need a bios_boot partition, just make sure when you get to the grub section you follow the right step for the grub-install
(+floppym) Do make sure to leave a 1 MB gap before the first partition.
(+floppym) fdisk does this by default.
(NewbieG) tdr, but in the handbook it is written that "the BIOS boot partition is needed when when the MBR partition layout is used with GRUB2 when the first partition starts earlier than the 1 MB location on the disk."
(+floppym) (starts at sector 2048)
(tdr) NewbieG, your fdisk will start you after the 1 MB spot
** tuxtor has joined #gentoo
(+floppym) NewbieG: The handbook doesn't say that...
(NewbieG) tdr, i am using parted i never use fdisk
(tdr) NewbieG, ok i dont know parted (because i dont like it)
** ssmike has quit (Ping timeout: 255 seconds)
(NewbieG) floppym, i with due respect sorry to differ but i just copy paste it from https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64/Installation/Disks
** silverhom has quit (Quit: Leaving)
** MasterPrenium`aw has joined #gentoo
(+floppym) NewbieG: Hmm. Well the handbook is wrong then; MBR has no concept of a "bios boot" partition.
(+floppym) That's a GPT-specific thing.
(NewbieG) tdr, Ok thanks. Now I am leaving that bios boot partition and also creating 1st partition after leaving atleast 1mb space
(tdr) NewbieG, it wont hurt if you dont need it anyway
** mackal has joined #gentoo
(tdr) NewbieG, my bios/mbr box i use the older grub on and dont need to worry about if i need that or not
** sidofren_ has joined #gentoo
(NewbieG) floppym, i actually thought that about why a mbr-bios need bios boot partition because as par my knowledge it actully boots automatically from the 1st sector of HHD, isn't it?
(+floppym) NewbieG: With grub, the BIOS loads the first sector, and then the first sector chainloads a larger image from somewhere else on the drive.
** Krennic has joined #gentoo
** valentind has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
(+floppym) NewbieG: Usually that larger image is embedded in sector 2 and beyond.
(tdr) NewbieG, yeah it puts a file by the mbr that is a pointer to where to find things on your /boot parittion (or its grub directory of / ) ... it shouldnt need that

(m_ben) I'm reading that especially linux users are affected by this new security flaw KRACK. what to do now?

(Psyb3rN4ut) m_ben: the security update went out yesterday....after only a few hours of vulnerability...you should upgrade ALL devices once the security flaw is patched for your platform
(m_ben) my wifi router is >10y old. I hope there will be an update
(Psyb3rN4ut) m_ben: until then....you might try using BT where possible

(tlhonmey) There was a bluetooth vulnerability just a couple of weeks ago.
(tdr) wraeth, thx dad :)
(tlhonmey) In the device discovery stuff.
(Psyb3rN4ut) m_ben: BT4 uses even fairly advanced frequency hopping....so the most an attacker will get is like your device saying "hello everyone!!! i am here!!!!
(+wraeth) tdr: *always* practice safe nets ;)
(tdr) wraeth, do i have to go to the clinic too?
(Kelsar) Psyb3rN4ut: bluetooth had an even bigger flaw just a month agon

(+wraeth) scrote: if you don't distribute binary packages, it's better to remove "bindist" (and "-bindist") from all /etc/portage/* files. if you /do/ distribute binaries, you may legally need it
(maolang) tom_: last update to the package is 5 years+ old, i think its time to look for something slightly more modern...
(+wraeth) scrote: also of note: don't mix different bindist states - either enable it globally or remove it entirely
(tom_) maolang, perhaps. Thank you for helping me test it.
(maolang) tom_: np
(FrostyBytes) bindist is kind of broken in the way its implemented too. the firefox bindist knob doesn't disable firefox branding properly. the openssl knob disables all EC algos, even those thought to be patent-unencumbered at this time. so even if you need to redistribute binaries, bindist doesn't do the right thing
(scrote) wraeth: thanks.

(TuxFuk) drforbin666: :(
(drforbin666) No it was linking error I got past it
(TuxFuk) oh nice
(drforbin666) your suggestion worked
(drforbin666) you guys are great....
(tdr) TuxFuk, is this the system just built a couple weeks ago?
(HungGarRebel) TuxFuk: I considered that but, I'd like it not to be pulled in by anything else at a later date
(TuxFuk) tdr: no. this is my desktop
(josef64) TuxFuk: Puh, this is only a sniped..
(tdr) TuxFuk, oh so you did the gcc-4 -> 5 migration and didn't rebuild things linked against c++
(TuxFuk) https://paste.pound-python.org/show/kjzOwxAXfAncm1WSkthV/
(TuxFuk) oh hey it is
(tdr) TuxFuk, you're not going to be able to build much until do you that revdep-rebuild (except break it)
(josef64) TuxFuk: see line 23 "emerge: there are no ebuilds to satisfy "www-plugins/adobe-flash:2"."
(josef64) please unistall this old dead slot
(TuxFuk) ltr*, plex, and linuxtrack were not installed with an ebuild
(drforbin666) what do you all think of clang?
(TuxFuk) so emerge -cav www-plugins/adobe-flash:2?
(tdr) TuxFuk, that =dev-qt/qtwebkit-4.8.7 thats old now kde4 stuff uses it
(tdr) TuxFuk, kde desktop on that box?
(TuxFuk) no
(TuxFuk) i3wm
(tdr) TuxFuk, i'd pull alot of that stuff out then before you do that revdep
(tdr) TuxFuk, anything qt etc you have
** signal4 has joined #gentoo
(TuxFuk) pull any qt things?
(tdr) TuxFuk, well anything old qt or old kde things
(TuxFuk) how do i know?
(tdr) TuxFuk, qlist -IC dev-qt
** zyliwax has quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
(tdr) TuxFuk, qlist -ICv dev-qt  is better (has versions)
** zyliwax has joined #gentoo
(tdr) TuxFuk, same with "kde"
(NewbieG) I just Install gentoo; but my wifi is not working, I have rt3290. I built rt3290 driver into the kernel. I am getting interface but i am unable to up my wifi. And says "RTNETLINK answers: No such file or directory". Do I need a frimware?
(TuxFuk) tdr: so remove the old versions
(tdr) TuxFuk, its all going to need rebuilt anyway
(TuxFuk) https://paste.pound-python.org/show/GNOdOtdnMuTL9Sgz2Ar4/
(tdr) TuxFuk, yeah, add | xargs emerge -C
(tdr) TuxFuk, or emerge -c

(tdr) NewbieG, dont build wifi in, do it as M so firmware can load from disk

(tdr) NewbieG, built in drivers cannot load firmware from disk.  either driver has to be M or you need to add the firmware file(s) to the kernel.. easiest route is to M the driver
(tdr) TuxFuk, if it lets you do that, it may not want the -a
(TuxFuk) !!! 'dev-qt/linguist-tools-5.7.1' is not a valid package atom.
(tdr) TuxFuk, it may also complain because things are using the libs ... so yuck
(tdr) TuxFuk, one sec
(TuxFuk) yup :/ https://paste.pound-python.org/show/wiIcMtQasM9UUhi5kgmF/
(tdr) TuxFuk, for x in `qlist -ICv dev-qt`; do emerge -C =$x ; done

(tdr) if you are using make menuconfig and building in the drivers you need to boot and dont have lvm/raid/crypt etc you just build it etc and insall the kernel and modules.  if you use genkernel, you give it the switches for the extras you might need
(pawiecki) Hi, what can cause my prompt to look like this: _root@prompt:~\prompt ~ #
(tdr) using menuconfig, you still need an initrd if you do have lvm/raid/crypt, do you'd need a ramdisk to match the new kernel too .. genkernel can handle that

(Manis) zyliwax: I meant the kernel cmdline (that you see in /proc/cmdline)
(zyliwax) --install is important to make sure the kernel is added to /boot
(zyliwax) Manis: ah! yes, you will need to indicate luks volume with crypt_root=UUID=lolololol and the unlocked rootfs (an LV right?) with root=/dev/WhateverVG/myroom

(anEpiov) vista: no xorg? what do you mean?

(anEpiov) in that case, yes framebuffer is slower than plain console.
(vista) fbterm is the proper term, if I recall correctly
(anEpiov) try good ol' console, the output is instant.
(vista) console?
(anEpiov) vista: long time ago while testing framebuffers and stuff I noticed when booting in plain console without framebuffer output was real time. Similar to what you're experiencing.
** Chinesium has quit (Quit: DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL (ETD.sys))

(Psyb3rN4ut) anEpiov: {sky,kaby}lake

(ld50) i'm having a feeling that i'm hitting a known problem, but have been unable to confirm this on the bugzilla or by googling around. since the baselayout (or is it openrc?) update, sshd does not start because it's "already running". that is not true, and it does work if i start sshd by hand. by best guess is that it detects the sshd instances in my lxc containers.

(blackflow) ld50: openrc is checking for /run/openrc/started/sshd
(blackflow) I suppose that's the check that's causing this, because otherwise -n should be given to start-stop-daemon to check by name instead of pidfile
(blackflow) and it isn't
** wednesday has joined #gentoo
(ld50) blackflow: /run should not be shared. i'll check (i have to walk over to the affected machine every time...)
** redeyedman_ has quit (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)
(Psyb3rN4ut) also...WHY, if it was not pulled in by emerging qutebrowser, does the world update pull it in?
(blackflow) ld50: you can't ssh to the host? ah, no because of this, right?
** josef_k has quit ()
** vHtQ18W has joined #gentoo
(ld50) blackflow: exactly ;) i could start sshd by hand but that would make my tests useless...
(ld50) i just checked, /run/openrc/started/sshd does not exist
(ld50) the container is running openrc 0.28 by the way, maybe this interacts badly with a openrc-0.32.1 host
(blackflow) ld50: I'm sorry then, don't know what else to check.

** shiznix has quit (Ping timeout: 255 seconds)
(blackflow) ld50: there's a hack you could try. instead of starting sshd in lxc through that lxc's rc, start it from the host side using lxc-start
(blackflow) ld50: copy /etc/init.d/sshd to sshd-lxc, prefix the command with lxc-start and whatever's necessary, in that one
(ld50) blackflow: i could make sshd start before lxc on the host, too and see what that does
(blackflow) true. I wonder if that'll prevent the in-lxc sshd to start
(ld50) i think i'll file a bug beforehand
(ld50) blackflow: i wondered that too. i'll find out soon!
(ld50) especially since openrc in the container is still at 0.28

(vHtQ18W) hi, I'm a new Gentoo user. After read wiki, I start install. After compile kernel, I plan to install kde. I have install vga driver, and setting udev, d-bus, etc. But get error in http://paste.ubuntu.com/25765581/. could anyone give me some suggestion ?
(Psyb3rN4ut) maolang: looking at the depends....it is all pulled in by virtual/rubygems...a dependency of app-text/docbook which is needed by pygtk?!, systemd?, dracut?!
(username234) Psyb3rN4ut: 1. setting -flag does not prevent a package from being pulled in. 2. all unmasked versions of qutebrowser require webkit
(Psyb3rN4ut) maolang: this seems utterly stupid....forcing me to install an entire dev-lang for app-text/docbook-xsl-stylesheets that is a dep somehow of pygtk?!! and systemd?!! and wha?! dracut!!!
(blackflow) ld50: I just did a check, I don't use lxc but I have apparmor enforced micro-chroots. It's something I'm developing currently. Tried duplicating a chroot, so it's exactly the same service (tested nginx) but different port. It works okay, rc will start both.
(Psyb3rN4ut) should i security audit my system?
(username234) vHtQ18W: you should emerge app-portage/cpuid2cpuflags and update your CPU_FLAGS_X86 variable accordingly.
(blackflow) ld50: however, I have _separate_ init files. /etc/init.d/chr_nginx and tested with chr_nginx_1
(blackflow) ld50: ps shows exactly the same named processes tho

(blackflow) ld50: so I'm guessing it's not checking the proccess name, but somethign else. the in-lxc rc shouldn't be able to see host-side procs anyway, so I doubt that's it even with the older openrc.

(+iamben) please everyone let's try to stick to gentoo linux support
(Psyb3rN4ut) NewbieG: it is what you use to not need an initramfs on efi sytems
(+iamben) Psyb3rN4ut: that's not accurate.
(Psyb3rN4ut) iamben: ?
(+iamben) Psyb3rN4ut: efistub can replace the external bootloader like grub, it doesn't replace initramfs in any way
(+iamben) you can still use initramfs with efistub, and a non-efistub boot setup doesnt' require initramfs either
(Psyb3rN4ut) iamben: so how would you not need an initramfs on a desktop system?
(+iamben) Psyb3rN4ut: needing initramfs has almost nothing to do with bootloader choice.
(NewbieG) Psyb3rN4ut, i am not using stub kernel
(+iamben) i dont even know how to answer your question, the 2 things are not related
(+grknight) Psyb3rN4ut: a "desktop system" has nothing to do with initramfs;  an initramfs' pupose is to simply prepare the rootfs to be accessed
(ehermes) to boot without an initramfs, build any modules needed at boot time into the kernel
(+iamben) initramfs usage *usually* has to do with where rootfs is, not where the kernel/bootloader are
(+iamben) not related to efistub.

(NewbieG) iamben, grknight, only for knowledge when we should use initramfs and why? Whats the pro and cons?
(Psyb3rN4ut) ehermes: what? really?...thats it?!...i think i have tried that and failed at getting it to work properly years ago....after that i never really questioned its use...are you sure that it is not required also for something else....or that common modules which cannot be compiled into the kernel are needed at boot time?
(+iamben) NewbieG: strictly speaking you only need initramfs when some "helpers" are needed to bring up rootfs.  that can be if rootfs is on raid/crypt/lvm, or if the kernel is highly modular and initramfs helps load modules, or maybe other reasons

(+grknight) NewbieG: it is nice to have in general to load modules and have a rescue shell if the rootfs is not found;  it is required when extra tools are needed to prepare/unlock the rootfs
(+iamben) a "generic" kernel like genkernel or a major distro one, usually uses a very modular kernel and use initramfs to bring things up.  so most distros use an initramfs.

(Hell-Razor) Pretty soon I am doing a hard upgrade for all my hardware. I am pretty sure I am going ot have to use UEFI. Is that still a huge pain?
(+iamben) keep rootfs simple, and keep all rootfs-related drivers built into the kernel, basically.
** majo has joined #gentoo
(Hell-Razor) iamben Fair enough. I figured there may be an alternate
(+iamben) UEFI is not much pain, but using an EFI-enabled livecd does help a lot.
(Psyb3rN4ut) Hell-Razor: no....but it is different...i needed help doing it for the first time

(anEpiov) Psyb3rN4ut: with efi stub you can perfectly boot without grub, it's kinda neat. However there are certain scenarios that initramfs still needed, such as external modules etc.
(+grknight) the downside to efistub is the inflexibility of the boot parameters
** eTeddy has quit (Quit: eTeddy)
(anEpiov) grknight: such as?

(anEpiov) I want to find out how to use two kernels at will.
(Psyb3rN4ut) grknight: perhaps....but on a desktop...i dont remeber the last time i have ever needed to do that
(+iamben) if you mean 2 kernels w/ efistub, just add efi boot entries for each of them

** AMT_ has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
(+iamben) Psyb3rN4ut: in a troubleshooting channel like this one, we see the need for custom/rescue/troubleshooting kernel params a lot =) and we're a bit frustrated when we have to wait for a kernel recompile to test a new param
(+iamben) so some of us may be a bit biased against efistub-only boot, it's a thorn in our sides at times
(anEpiov) I tried to use grub2 failed horribly, now I use plain efi stub
(+iamben) if you need help with grub2, we help fix that every day here.
(+grknight) Psyb3rN4ut: say you update xorg and you get stuck on a "black screen", some systems, including OpenRC, allow a nox parameter passed to the kernel to bypass xorg autostart (or specifying a different target for systemd).  a boot loader/manager can add that while a stub cannot
** buscher has joined #gentoo

** ssmike has joined #gentoo

(+iamben) for most intents and purposes, that is rebooting almost completely, so don't get your hopes too high
(maolang) Psyb3rN4ut: exactly you will shave at best 2 maybe 3 seconds but thats it
(+iamben) the hardware won't reinitialize (no POST, etc) but the entire OS will reboot
(+grknight) maolang: depends on the hardware
(grawity) speaking from experience, the less often you reboot, the harder it tends to break when you do... and the harder it is to remember how to fix it

** poeppman_ has joined #gentoo
** fefelix has quit (Quit: Leaving.)
(maolang) yes, all the way down to restarting process immediately upon reloading new kernel
(+grknight) something would have to shut them down
(maolang) process 1 that was
(maolang) cant say though for openrc, as i use it on systemd, but basicaly it shuts off everything, all the way to systemd including it, activate new kernel, load systemd and rest goes as normal
(maolang) so no bios posting or grubbing or efi
(+grknight) the OpenRC kexec file has 2 modes and is somewhat confusing
(grawity) if you run `systemctl kexec`, that works almost like a regular reboot, except it doesn't call reboot(2) at the end
** poeppman has quit (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
(grawity) i.e. systemd stops all the services and such
(maolang) yah almost, it basically shorts of reboot as you would on a normal restart, and directly activates new kernel which you previously loaded into with kexec
** quamtumslash has quit (Quit: quamtumslash)

(maolang) doubt it but its true looking at the difference on that side for openrc seems to be much more involved script wise!

** azahi has joined #gentoo
(maolang) i dont use it automatically so cant say, i only use it manually

(Psyb3rN4ut) iamben: ? wha?
(grawity) ehermes: makes it easier though
(Psyb3rN4ut) iamben: so it is only pre-installed copy that forces uefi/secureboot?
(+iamben) Psyb3rN4ut: win8 and later preinstalled, will be preinstalled in UEFI mode.  but you can reinstall in BIOS mode, or any retail copy you buy can be installed in either mode.
(grawity) Psyb3rN4ut: only the ARM "WinRT" devices, afaik
(Psyb3rN4ut) Hell-Razor: also....you might try gaming in a vm with pci passthrough
(grawity) Psyb3rN4ut: x86 ones may come with secureboot enabled, but always have a disable option
(ehermes) NVidia does not allow PCI passthrough to virtual machines unless you buy their expensive enterprise-grade cards.
(Hell-Razor) Psyb3rN4ut the coffee lake compiles almost as well as the threadrippers but out preforms it in speed (gaming). Selling point? Motherboards arent 3-500$ lol
(Psyb3rN4ut) grawity: when i did it for win8 it did not boot in legacy bios mode
(grawity) you were unlucky
(+iamben) Psyb3rN4ut: you cannot switch the boot mode on the fly, it will usually require a reinstall
(Hell-Razor) Psyb3rN4ut YEah I thought about that. I feel though that it will be poor because I am building this machine to do 4k gaming as well as be a powerhouse when it comes to compiling

** random_james_awa is now known as random_james
(Psyb3rN4ut) iamben: yes....so for a lappy with a preinstalled copy of windows....to dual-boot needs uefi?
(Psyb3rN4ut) that is what i meant
(ehermes) not if you are willing to reinstall windows. but I don't see the benefit of moving to BIOS anyway.
(grawity) Psyb3rN4ut: yes, if it was installed with uefi, you can't *easily* switch it to bios without a reinstall
(+iamben) Psyb3rN4ut: if you want to do it without reinstalling windows, yeah.  unless you wanted to really awkwardly use UEFI for windows and legacy boot for linux

** Joseph_Vissarion has joined #gentoo
(Hell-Razor) How about this ehermes, what will do better in a google environment, the i7 coffee lake or the threadripper?
(Psyb3rN4ut) Hell-Razor: anyway...kabylake is skylake with issues fixed and on steroids...coffeelake is adding new things...what comes after will be with issues fixed
(Psyb3rN4ut) Hell-Razor: also....i am running the experimental kernel.....and in cpu-type it supports up to skylake
(Hell-Razor) Psyb3rN4ut something lake. I cant remember the name
(Psyb3rN4ut) Hell-Razor: soon it will support kaby
(ehermes) threadripper wins in pure compute power, but coffee lake will win in single-threaded performance, which is more important for gaming. but again, this is not gentoo support related
(Hell-Razor) Psyb3rN4ut I tend to learn more towards the reason why its not working is due to the fact that coffelake release supplies were a joke. When more people come accustome to it, I am sure the kernels will be patched.

(Muzer) I think it tries to load it then decides against it
(Muzer) I've actually reconfigured my kernel without it so I guess if I cleared out /lib/modules and reinstalled them I wouldn't have that problem any more
(DarkRyu550) is there a way to start the nvidia proprietary driver framebuffer for the ttys as soon as the system starts, as opposed to having to start x for that?
(NewbieG) iamben, i have seen something strange when type ps faux in one row its showing " root  ........... /sbin/dhcpcd -q"
(maolang) DarkRyu550: if you use the nvidia-drivers you are using the nvidia for the tty normally....
** jamesc|2 has joined #gentoo
(tdr) Muzer, oh its just trying alot of random stuff, your dmesg gives the familiar warning about loading the binary nvidia taints it
(hanna) tdr: Hmm, even if I manually coax it to build statically, it fails because of missing dependencies like pthread; and apparently e.g. glibc doesn't have the USE="static-lib" option either
(hanna) I guess I'm out of luck

Disabling it system-wide then doing 'emerge -avUD @world' will resolve the conflict when something required -bindist on openssl.

** scrote has quit (Quit: Lost terminal)
(+grknight) LazyGnoll: yes and no
(willikins) wraeth: https://bugs.gentoo.org/473332 "Remove bindist useflag from default make.conf"; Gentoo Release Media, Stages; IN_P; patrick:release
(+kurly) LazyGnoll: it's a nonsensical default, if that's not reason enough
(+kurly) the stage3 itself could be distributed with the binaries compiled with it and the make.conf not containing it; your first world update out of the box would rebuild openssh and openssl
(+kurly) or like grknight mentions, there is the possibility of the patch that'll let us simply distribute binaries with bindist off (as far as the stage3 goes)
(+grknight) once bug 531540 happens, we might even revisit what needs it on as well

(stuck1) guys guys
(stuck1) please
(stuck1) what is bindist?
(+wraeth) !keyword bindist
(willikins) wraeth: bindist is the USE flag that controls whether code that cannot legally be distribued in binaries is built for a package. Enabling 'bindist' stops this code being built and allows the binaries to be distributed, whereas disabling 'bindist' allows the code to be compiled, though you are not permitted to distribute the binary(s) to other users.

(jmbailey) ok, so perl finished fine 2 of 6, kent\n, I believe I have test enabled (so it seemed for perl), nothing bad happened. Is there some issue with it being enabled?
(+ChrisADR) hi, any idea why eix does not show wordpress when I do eix wordpress?
(+kent\n) jmbailey: nah, just with FEATURES=test, the number of dependencies you'll pull will quadruple, and the odds of a test failing and your portage stopping in the middle thus go up exponentially
** tschosie has quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
(+wraeth) ChrisADR: try eix-update - the cache may be out of date
(+wraeth) ChrisADR: you should eix-update after each sync
(+kent\n) and when you have portage stop in the middle of a perl upgrade, it can misbehave :)
(+ChrisADR) wraeth: yea :/ I just did, twice
(jmbailey) kent\n: oh ok.
(+ChrisADR) wraeth: or does it has something to do with the fact that I'm syncing portage with git?
(+kent\n) jmbailey: for instance, if you installed the newer mariadb, then installed DBD::mysql, due to a yet to be fixed bug due to the newer mariadb, DBD::mysql will fail its tests ( serious linker breakage ), and portage will spit :)
(+wraeth) ChrisADR: no, that shouldn't matter, unless you're not using the sync repo but are using the dev repo instead
(+kent\n) with tests disabled, DBD::mysql successfully installs in a broken state, but your emerge keeps going, which is a good thing, or a bad thing, depending on perspective
(+ChrisADR) mmm nope... I can see other packages, but I can't tell if wordpress is the only one, I just discovered that a bit ago
(+wraeth) does emerge --search find it?

(rollexus) \an someone please help me? Even if this machine has to stay up all night recompiling everything from scratch
(+kurly) rollexus: ehhh... that's not going to be easy, are you sure you need to?
** rogue_koder has joined #gentoo
(rollexus) Not sure if I actually need it... However, I don't want to have to patch something when I am strapped for time
(maolang) rollexus: might be easier most likely to copy your current config alter the unstable bits out and make an installation in parallel...

(rollexus) Can anyone help?
(+kurly) "patch something"?
(+kurly) rollexus: wgetpaste -I
(+wraeth) and the easiest (though not speediest) way to switch to stable would probably be to lock current exact versions in ~arch and switch global back to stable

(hololeap) i need some help figuring out why i'm getting a particularly nasty GRUB error: "attempt to read or write outside of disk 'hd0'"
(+wraeth) ChrisADR: so `eix wordpress` results in a single "No matches found"?
(+ChrisADR) yes
(hololeap) i have the whole drive as a lvm partition. the funny thing is that i can ls the whole filesystem, including /boot, from the grub commandline. but, if i do `linux /boot/kernel...` i get that same error
(rollexus) kurly: https://paste.pound-python.org/show/jVetgI2tt1tRuX0AiSUf/
(username234) hololeap: just lvm? no actual partition table?
(+wraeth) ChrisADR: then i'm not sure - eix-update should be refreshing the cache, which should be built on your active repos..
** piremi has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
** in1t3r has joined #gentoo

(rollexus) You guys don't think it's worth the effort? I can buy that
(username234) hololeap: hmm... so grub stage1 has to find /boot inside an LVM...
(username234) hololeap: how big is the LVM partition?
(+ChrisADR) wraeth: yea :/ I'll need to dig a bit to find a reasonable cause... but I can't trust eix right now :/ hahaha
** Namarrgon has joined #gentoo
(username234) hololeap: and by that I mean, how big is the 1 MBR partition...
(maolang) rollexus: i would reuse the configmake.conf package.use etc etc into a new install and do it in parallel after mdding out the unstable bits, but not downgrade an unstable system especially if its working... too many movingparts involved lol
(hololeap) username234: which it does successfully, and i can use ls inside the grub commandline to view the filesystem, so obviously it has no problem reading that data... it's 32GB
(hololeap) username234: it has no problem getting to stage2
(username234) hololeap: and the disk itself is only 32GB ?
(rollexus) Makes sense
(hololeap) username234: it's a usb drive... don't ask ;)
(rollexus) It;s for my laptop so i may just live with it...
(hololeap) the only issue is when i actually try to load the kernel

(rollexus) Another question / is running of disk space. I have another partition with a lot of room. How can I save myself from having to re-partition and install from scratch>
** ZeuZ has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
(rollexus) maolang: I trust you
** piremi has joined #gentoo
(maolang) rollexus: you could boot a live dvd, create a new partition , rsync the /home into it, adjust the fstab, and once all has been moved free the space from the original spot
** berti has quit (Disconnected by services)
** berti_ has joined #gentoo
(hololeap) other people having that error have suggested setting up a seperate boot partition, which i may end up doing, but i don't understand why i'm getting the error since it can obviously see the bzimage
(hololeap) anyway, i've asked in #grub as well
(maolang) rollexus: ofc use rsync with options to keep all permissions etc as the original, besides that not much more to it
** damke has joined #gentoo
(rollexus) maolang: thank you I am trying to picture it in my mind
(maolang) rollexus: first get an idea of free space df -h / then check how much room for example your /home is eating... --> du -csx
** lethu has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
(maolang) du -csx /home

(rollexus) aaahhh ok! I should have mentioned /home is in it's own partition

(rollexus) what's next?
(rollexus) "var/log"
(hololeap) screw it, i found the lines of code in grub-core/kern/disk_common.c ... i'm going to comment them out and recompile
(maolang) well if you have enough room on the same HD, perhaps push the size down towards the end of the hd so you can have bigger partitions, also suggested if using resize and such to do it as you cannot do sizes modifications and such on mounted partitions from a booted live dvd

(maolang) if you boot boot from it you will need to make sure the drivers for the controller are as * in your kernel or using an initramfs....
(earendil) of course its possible, but the devil is in the details
(rollexus) ahh yes
(rollexus) boot is in it's own partition
(rollexus) Sorry
(rollexus) Yes I do boot boot from it

(laertus) i'll try that
(cronolio) if keep in the mind that https://sourceforge.net/projects/infozip/files/UnZip%206.x%20%28latest%29/ unzip was released in 2009 ... required some new package
(+kurly) cronolio: what problem are you trying to solve?
** piremi has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
(hololeap) cronolio: unfortunately, it would be difficult to do a drop-in replacement for that since so many packages depend on it. the best you could do is make a custom ebuild that installs your replacement but is still named app-arch/unzip
(hololeap) (seems like a weird thing to do though unless you actually know of a bug/problem with the default unzip)

(R0b0t1) NewbieG: By default Intel should be used. You have to go out of your way to enable the discrete card in most cases.
(R0b0t1) On some older gaming laptops the discrete card may be wired directly to the screen. In that case, you will not be able to route video output from the Intel iGPU to the screen.
(R0b0t1) The next stepping included a motherboard controlled multiplexer in addition to NVIDIA's Optimus or the open-source Bumblebee equivalent. By default, it should connect the Intel iGPU to the screen.

(NewbieG) tdr, i really don't know whatever is using bindist

(tdr) there is /etc/protage/package.use for when you want a flag to be different only for a specific package etc

(wokko) newbieG1: do you have 'multilib' useflag enabled on 'nvidia-drivers'?
(tdr) futurefutura, the scheduler will be used by the host
(tdr) wokko, yeah thats it
(newbieG1) wokko, No
(futurefutura) tdr thank you for so quick reply .... i dont understand what you mean with "the scheduler will be used by the host" ?

(tdr) futurefutura, your guests will also have a scheduler of course, but if you want bfq to be used by them, you'll have to set it

(clin) to change this? What do I blame? GTK?

(tdr) newbieG1, technically yes.  but your nvidia-drivers has a flag set that builds the 32 bit versions of it too.  those 32 bit things that want to build are what that piece needs to built
(tdr) newbieG1, they are very tiny libraries
(newbieG1) tdr, so then I can neglect that
(tdr) newbieG1, i'd just let them build
(tdr) newbieG1, if you do a work around to make it not build them, if you ever do need 32 bit apps (wine or maybe steam) then they wont be able to use the nvidia stuff
(newbieG1) tdr, because my main fear is setting xorg-server because i have hybride graphics (intel + nvdia)

(jax) so guys, i experienced a VERY odd issue last night with /etc/conf.d/net after rebooting. Could it be, that when you have multiple IPs on an interface, that you need to define the lowest IPs first? i.e 123.123.123.100/21 123.123.123.200/21 123.123.123.300/21 in config_eth0 ?

(newbieG1) tdr, Nvidia 32bit isn't bothering me;........... these gnome etc I think is redundant........ so I will removes those later?
(jax) grawity: they did all show up in ip addr and ip route
(jax) i could try it now, by simply doing: ip addr add 123.123.123.240/21 dev eth0
(jax) and see if it is accessible

(tdr) NewbieG, the things its pulling that start with gnome are only some backend parts some other software uses

(tdr) hackepiet, did the init=  part of your grub config get removed?
(hackepiet) i also upgraded kernel from 4.9 to 4.12, but when i boot into 4.9 i have the same problem
(hackepiet) tdr: where exactly is this line supposed to be?
(tdr) hackepiet, if you configured your kernel using menuconfig, did you pick openrc vs systemd on the Gentoo menu (top level screen)
(tdr) hackepiet, systemd gets an option on the line that lists your kernel as part of the grub.cfg
(tdr) hackepiet, the lines starting with "linux ...."
** Logomachist has quit (Ping timeout: 255 seconds)
(hackepiet) i didnt change the settings in gentoo linux section in kernel menuconfig
(hackepiet) let me check grub
(hackepiet)  /init yields no results in vim oO
(tdr) hackepiet, most people using systemd add a grub option so whenever grub-mkconfig is executed it knows to add the option every time
** upperdeck has quit (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)
(hackepiet)  /boot/grub/grub.cfg that is
(tdr) hackepiet, GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="init=/usr/lib/systemd/systemd"  added to /etc/default/grub ?
(hackepiet) it is commented out
(newbieG1) tdr, One thing suppose I put -gnome in use flag then is it then what will happen?? is it able to pull those file(files which is pulling right now....files as you stated backend parts some other software needed)?
(tdr) hackepiet, not sure how it boots systemd without it specifying init= as part of the config
(hackepiet) so i uncomment and run grubmk-config?
(tdr) newbieG1, -gnome will remove gnome deps whenever they are optional
(tdr) hackepiet, i would yes
(tdr) hackepiet, no other line in that file right?
(hackepiet) im rebooting
** Logomachist has joined #gentoo

(futurefutura) tdr i think i understand now -- my host is with bfq, ok, but since my VMs are Windows-Machines, they off course dont use bfq but their own scheduler -- and therefor they wont benefit at all :)
(tdr) futurefutura, anthing the host does for them regarding disks will take advantage of the bfq tho

(jax) is there an easy way to upgrade from kernel 3.8.13 to the newest?
(tdr) King_DuckZ, are you surprised?
(jax) not using genkernel
(King_DuckZ) that means I have to enable splitdebug on all of gcc :s
(tdr) jax, did you use genkernel before?
(King_DuckZ) tdr: not very surprised, but I was hoping I would find a separate, smaller package
(jax) no
(tdr) jax, load your old config into the new menuconfig.   if you did "oldconfig" its going to have a ton of stuff .. so just look through it
(tdr) jax, btw, be aware the newest kernel has pci-based usb support as optional on the usb menu ... you probably want that
(jax) it's actually a KVM Guest server
(jax) most drivers are just vitio drivers
(tdr) jax, your emulated usb (if any) is probably still connected to the virtual pci bus

(FireBurn|Work) It does one moment let me get the right command
(FireBurn|Work) revdep-rebuild -L libc.so.6 -L libgcc_s.so.1 -L libstdc++.so.6

(Kelsar) johnfg: does not change anything, if you followed the handbook, network should allready autostart, maybe just add sshd to the dafault runlevel
(Kelsar) sddm has nothing to do with network

(FireBurn|Work) Oh are you using systemd?
(johnfg) Kelsar: FireBurn|Work yes, systemd.
(FireBurn|Work) I had an issue where sddm would wait until the wifi connected before starting
(FireBurn|Work) There was a service you can add to make it do that
(FireBurn|Work) Or remove if you don't want it
(Kelsar) johnfg: how did you configure your network? networkd? gentoo netifrc?
(FireBurn|Work) I'll try and find the name
(johnfg) And for some reason, the network doesn't start up until after login on the machine.
(Kelsar) sound like networkmanager with a user network config instead of a global one
(FireBurn|Work) systemctl enable NetworkManager-wait-online.service
(johnfg) networkd I think.
(Kelsar) johnfg: well, where did you configure something? networkd is in /etc/systemd/networkd
(FireBurn|Work) If you enable that service then stuff waits for your network connection
(Kelsar) johnfg: lan or wlan?

(Psyb3rN4ut) johnfg: i dont know if it was solved....but it seems to be a plasma issue and i suggested that it may be like some aggressive power-saving stuff
(johnfg) Kelsar: Psyb3rN4ut that was me i'm sure, on kde-plasma.
(johnfg) Psyb3rN4ut: checked, and that doesn't seem to be the issue.
(Kelsar) johnfg: did you configure your wlan with the plasma applet?
(johnfg) Kelsar: In my settings, I don't seem to have a selection to do what you mentioned.
(Psyb3rN4ut) johnfg: you are the guy with the centos machine adjacent in your office trying to ssh to home lappy?

(Psyb3rN4ut) johnfg: sort of not great mem with names
(Psyb3rN4ut) johnfg: we ruled out the DM
(johnfg) Kelsar: I believe so, don't remember for sure.
(Kelsar) johnfg: sorry, not on a machine with networkmanager right now, but that setting should exist somewhere. if it is a pure user connection, passwords and such will be given to networkmanager only after you logged in. If you make it a system connection, they are always there

(Psyb3rN4ut) iamben: however on my lappy that has an sshd for rsync music to my phone....i use connman and can rsync over wifi using adb on the lappy and rsync client on phone after reboot without logging in no prob
(+kensington) pecan: we always try to stabilise packages with security issues ASAP
(+iamben) Psyb3rN4ut: i believe connman only has system-wide connections (stored in /var/lib/connman/) and NetworkManager has system-wide and per-user
(Psyb3rN4ut) iamben: so perhaps that is the issue?
(+iamben) Psyb3rN4ut: yes, that's what Kelsar is helping him fix
(+iamben) NM uses /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/
(Psyb3rN4ut) iamben: johnfg should perhaps check if the connection is "user" or systemwide...or use connman?

(+iamben) megaTherion: it may be the issue josef64 mentioned where it tries to be efficient and trim things it THINKS are unused by your enabled drivers, even though your out-of-tree vbox needs them
(megaTherion) grknight: wow they must be really bad coders
(+kensington) recommending writing one's own crypto anything is really bad advice
(Psyb3rN4ut) ArRay_: do you have -qt or something in your flags?
(megaTherion) "I assume you have an generic linux" wtf is an generic linux :D
(megaTherion) rofl
(ArRay_) Psyb3rN4ut: I don't have it explicitely
** kiuma has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
(rullie) megaTherion: one that's generic, doh
** Krennic has joined #gentoo
(megaTherion) rullie: that in one line with linux sounds more like an oxymoron to me ^^
(megaTherion) anyways I added a bunch of useless drivers and now it works \o/
* Kelsar is happy with his keepass
** victorx has joined #gentoo
(+iamben) megaTherion: this is one of the annoyances of 3rd party kernel modules like vbox
(+iamben) in-tree drivers don't have that problem
** Krennic has quit (Quit: WeeChat 1.9.1)
(Psyb3rN4ut) ArRay_: it looks like qt5 is missing dbus support
(+grknight) ArRay_: the solution is to do 'emerge dev-qt/qtdbus:5' until that bug is fixed at which time you can --deselect it
(+grknight) Psyb3rN4ut: you need to read the bug line from the bot
(ArRay_) grknight: I don't think I'll remember to do that, but ok

(mark4) unmerge wine and emerge wine-vanilla?
(+iamben) yes
(mark4) why this fragmented versions?
(+iamben) or any one of the other wine-* variants
(+iamben) there was a news item about this, i think
(+iamben) it's "fragmented" to allow you to have more than one type and version of wine to be installed together
(mark4) so should i take "any" or "vanilla" ?
(+iamben) "any" will still allow you to pick patchsets via USE flags.  vanilla will be (mostly) unpatched.

(hololeap) iamben: funny thing; emerge --info shows that it respects EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS as an env variable, so i could just set that in .bashrc
(+iamben) hololeap: oh of course you can pass it from your calling environment, sure
(+iamben) you could do that with MAKEOPTS as well, so it gets set @ shell login time before ever calling emerge
(hololeap) cool

(mark4) well even after updating wine to wine-any im still stalling every few seconds :/
(mark4) yea, it might even be worse now lol
(+iamben) mark4: it was more about the wine version change than package change, you did get 2.17-r1 right?
(kishmesh) when updating the system (e.g. emerge -au), apart form seeing the version change of packages, is there are a way to display/link the list of "changes" the update of each packages brings?

(mark4) and yes thats -r1 lol bad cut/paste
(+iamben) mark4: maybe you'll have better luck if you enable some patchsets like staging.  maybe you have a video driver issue.
(mark4) pissible. how do i enable that? witha use flag?
(mark4) or is it wine-staging package?
** wizardedit has quit (Quit: Leaving)
** bcowan has quit (Client Quit)
(+iamben) you can get wine-staging, or enable USE=staging on wine-any
(+iamben) wine-any allows you to mix/match various patchsets (at your own risk), wine-staging applies only the staging patchset

(Psyb3rN4ut) i am on full ~amd64
(+iamben) NewbieG: so that's probably the cause of xorg-server's input issues, can you do "/etc/init.d/udev restart --nodeps" and see if it prints any errors?
(ecormier) thanks kurly, I'm not sure how to proceed, maybe a keyword
(+iamben) Psyb3rN4ut: pretty normal yes
(Psyb3rN4ut) iamben: ok
(+floppym) ecormier: Wait a day or so and the new chromium will probably be marked stable. Or add it to package.accept_keywords if you are in a rush.
(+kurly) ecormier: if you can wait a day or two, it should solve itself.  or ... yeah floppym beat me to it.
(ecormier) thanks floppym kurly I'll keyword for now and remove it when it's stabilized

(thican) Hello everyone, I have a problem starting the daemon "xdm" very recently (it was working earlier today) since I updated the package x11-apps/xinit-1.3.4-r2 (from -r1)
(Psyb3rN4ut) iamben: does ff use gtk+? as chromium pulled in ">=x11-libs/gtk+-3.22.19 X"
(+iamben) Psyb3rN4ut: yes, it does use gtk+
(thican) In fact, the service through the script /etc/X11/startDM.sh is unable to find the command get_options
(+iamben) thican: there have been some recent fixes.  sync and upgrade xinit again, or install gentoo-functions
(thican) And the problem is I am unable to get a graphical session, so I can research info
** SpudDogg has joined #gentoo

(+iamben) grknight: ah it's one that wasn't actually moved over.
(+grknight) a major discussion in #-dev was what to do with that script
** stuck1 has quit (Quit: WeeChat 1.9.1)
(+iamben) yes i've been following that, but it wasn't clear to me that the function was still only in openrc's functions.sh
(+grknight) really it isn't, but openrc's functions.sh sources it

** pecan has quit (Quit: Lost terminal)
(thican) ok, il will try to get a device with a webrowser, thanks
(+grknight) iamben: yes, that one sources many others
(+grknight) fwiw, startDM.sh is about to be dropped from inittab
(+iamben) i see that being mentioned now, isnt it there for a good reason? or is it worked around in another way now?
(+iamben) newbieG1: kernel config looks fine, not sure what's going on here
(+iamben) newbieG1: youre booted to a real gentoo, not chrooted, right?
(+grknight) afaik, the whole reason is so that a DM gets started on tty7 and not others.  but i dunno if that's valid today

(+iamben) maybe we're just all getting a little worn out by all your different "this doesn't work on wayland" complaints the last few days
(+iamben) in one breath you claim you just need things that work to get work done, in the next breath you swear that going full wayland is your top priority
** nuno_nunes has joined #gentoo
(Psyb3rN4ut) iamben: sorry....i am not trying to "complain"...about wayland at least....
(Psyb3rN4ut) iamben: i have xwayland....and am trying to keep the system as "pure" as possible without losing "essential" functionality...
** S0rin has quit (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)
(Kelsar) xwayland is just another x server
(+grknight) X11 is 20+ years old for a reason, it takes a heck of a long time to replace it
(mark4) isnt wayland vaporware?
** King_DuckZ has joined #gentoo
(Kelsar) mark4: wayland itself works pretty well these days, just the toolkits haven't catched up yet
(Psyb3rN4ut) iamben: perhaps i should watch my phrasing....as i am merely trying to pick the brains of the pool of great minds here...and "pay it LEFT" when i can
(King_DuckZ) hi, I've recompiled gcc with splitdebug and I do have /usr/lib64/debug/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/5.4.0/libstdc++.so.6.0.21.debug now, but in gdb I'm still unable to see inside functions
(mark4) Kelsar, will it replace X outright some day?
(King_DuckZ) do I have to start gdb in a special way?
(Kelsar) mark4: likely
(mark4) if not theres no point, might as well stay with the relic we have :)
** xy2_ has quit (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)

(mark4) LOL
(mark4) well... the statement was CORRECT - just not accurate :)
** xy2_ has joined #gentoo

(Kelsar) King_DuckZ: you got no debug symbols
(Psyb3rN4ut) mark4: there are technichal reasons to switch to wayland...if both were equally supported...wayland is the obvious choice
(King_DuckZ) Kelsar: so what's that .debug file?

(mark4) is that a compatability layer?
(Psyb3rN4ut) mark4: yes
(Kelsar) King_DuckZ: dunno, would take a look at the manpage
(Kelsar) mark4: xwayland is a X Server running ontop of wayland instead on top of drm
** toralf_ has quit (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)
(mark4) Kelsar, so slower... ?
(Kelsar) mark4: why would it be slower?
(Psyb3rN4ut) mark4: also...all the command line stuff works....and most of your guis are qt or gtk...both of which work fine on wayland....currently ff and chrome need gtk+ with X use flag
(mark4) its purely academic right now, not intending to switch unless theres a need to
(Kelsar) Psyb3rN4ut: chrome has wayland support, ff can work on wayland too
(mark4) Kelsar, X -> DRM  or X -> Wayland -> DRM
(Kelsar) mark4: no, X adds layers too, really does not make a real difference
(Kelsar) mark4: but i am not sure all x extensions are supported
(mark4) aha
** Cyp_ has joined #gentoo
(mark4) does anyone here run it?
(Psyb3rN4ut) Kelsar: yes...ok...on my setup i needed gtk+ with X use flag for it to open a window...is that because it defaults to using xwayland? and if so...what can i change to trim out the dependency?
(Kelsar) mark4: i try it every now and then, nothing to be productive
(mark4) something to keep on the radar for "some day" then
(Kelsar) Psyb3rN4ut: use xprop to test it, if the cursor changes it runs in xwayland
** azahi has quit (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
(Kelsar) mark4: most wayland DEs basically run all the apps on xwayland
(Psyb3rN4ut) mark4: the ONLY thing i am lacking on "pure" wayland is the dev-browser....if i can get ff without X...i am golden...full dev-system on wayland with sway

(Kelsar) where konsole is the only one working well with sway, atleast without gtk patch
(Psyb3rN4ut) Kelsar: maybe i try that and quit futzing w urxvt
(mark4) gnome-terminal does everything wrong.  black isnt even color 0 and they keep changing the color map (though not the colors)
(Kelsar) Psyb3rN4ut: you won't get happy with that
(Psyb3rN4ut) does konsole force a bunch of kde deps?

(mark4) one L
(mark4) kind of a limp wristed name but it works good

(Psyb3rN4ut) aranea2: so an attacker would use bootable media to read /etc/passwd and recalculate the hash which is expected to be in /etc/shadow? and if on usb then they could provide it?

(+iamben) volt: the default make.conf had it enabled, make sure you remove it from there.  make sure you are applying that USE change to all packages on the next upgrade, like "emerge --newuse --deep @world", if you only change the flag on a subset, the other ones may "tug" it back to the other state

(+wraeth) testerbeta: if you're getting a build failure with an ebuild, we would need to see the log. that being said, chromium-63.* is masked currently, so it's known (or reasonably expected) to have problems
(Muzer) wraeth: hmm, I could stick an inotify wait in that script actually
(Muzer) would be less hacky than polling or a sleep I think
(Muzer) the sleep does work though :P
** sasukeskapa has quit (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
(+wraeth) newgentoouser: maybe, maybe not - you're currently using the ubuntu kernel, so when you boot your own system it will be using your kernel. the "predictable interface names" is supposed to help address that, but it's somewhat less predictable than the name would suggest ;)
(Muzer) predictable or memorable, choose one ;)
(+wraeth) Muzer: sure, but you'd also have to put a timeout, otherwise if sddm fails you'll have a zombie waiting for something that won't get created

(fauxm) I think dhcpcd is the standard
** SpudDogg has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
(newgentoouser) It had some serious impact on boot times last I checked
(tdr) newgentoouser, some folks report problems with dhcpcd and networkmanager (i think its nm) ... dhclient from the "dhcp" package also works
(Skunky) newgentoouser: udhcp, dhcpcd, pump, dhclient... pick one.
(fauxm) newgentoouser: I have a work around for that
(newgentoouser) Thanks, I'll check out dhclient
(tdr) newgentoouser, if you add dhcp (probably want -server on it) to get dhclient, you can remove dhcpcd
(FrostyBytes) dhcp isn't slow because the client is slow. it's slow because the server tries to do duplicate address detection before assigning an ip
(fauxm) have your network interfaces start in the default runlevel instead of boot
(fauxm) and dhcpcd
(+wraeth) tdr: i believe NM uses dhclient by default, if not it's own dhcp implementataion
** paul374 has joined #gentoo

(+kurly) fauxm: you just blew away a lifetime of savings of using tmpfs build space. *shrug*

** viaCrucis has joined #gentoo
(fauxm) kurly: what do you mean?
(+kurly) newgentoouser: dhcpcd is neither slow nor deprecated; it does follow the RFCs
(+wraeth) no, dhcpcd itself is not deprecated, but NM's use of it was, iirc. sorry if that was unclear
(+kurly) fauxm: if you use tmpfs to build because it's "faster", you lost a lifetime's worth of savings with one failed build

(+wraeth) okay, then can you try `USE=-pulseaudio emerge -uUDp @world` and see if it lists more packages? if it does, it means things have already been built with pulseaudio support

(+wraeth) have you installed anything that needs the pulseaudio USE flag..? as far as i can tell, the flag is set and anything needing it should have it enabled, but given nothing is getting rebuilt when it's disabled, you don't have anything installed with a pulseaudio USE flag
** nwx_ has joined #gentoo

(+wraeth) if there are any packages installed that require it, sure
(newgentoouser) Oh, I see
(+wraeth) it won't get pulled in if nothing needs it
(newgentoouser) So, say, I take in mpv, it should pull in pulse?
(+wraeth) yes, based on your current USE flags
(newgentoouser) I see, thanks. So how about nouveau?
(+wraeth) nouveau is a graphics driver - it has no use for pulseaudio
(newgentoouser) No, I mean, I want to use it :P I set VIDEO_CARDS="nouveau" in make.conf, but it doesn't pull it in
(newgentoouser) is it the same idea? I need something installed that uses it?
(newgentoouser) Though X should be installed
** mgorbach has joined #gentoo

** trumee has joined #gentoo
(Terlisimo) ok, how do i tell genkernel that I have two devices that need to be decrypted? there is crypt_root= but this only allows for a single device and I have two (mirror)
** alextai has joined #gentoo
(tdr) Terlisimo, you probably crypted on top of the mirror though right?
** hatdag is now known as kiboney
** kiboney is now known as kiboneu
(Terlisimo) no, raw device -> luks -> zfs
(tdr) i would have chosen to crypt on top the zfs
(Terlisimo) but then zfs will store just a raw drive, and I will have only 1 zfs filesystem so I can't have separate for things like portage, src etc
** day__ has joined #gentoo
(Terlisimo) I could let it boot with just 1 device, after boot decrypt 2nd device and let zfs resilver any changes
(Terlisimo) but having it decrypt both at boot would be nicer
(NewbieG) Is there any webbrowser which is powerful and lightweight and which i should install on i3wm?
(tdr) one side of the mirror should be enough for it to get switch to your root fs where it would find your fstab entry referencing the mirror anyway
(tdr) NewbieG, if you want features that actually work + are secure, you want either firefox or chrome
** daey has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
** day__ is now known as daey
(Terlisimo) powerful XOR lightweight heh
(tdr) Terlisimo, i still think doing the crypt under the zfs is weird, i'd back that up and switch how its done
(NewbieG) tdr, but what you mean by Chrome... Closed source chrome or chromium
(tdr) NewbieG, either
(tdr) portage has both
(+kurly) NewbieG: you might get better results in #gentoo-chat; this channel is more for "how do I get this working" than "which one should I use"
** upperdeck has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
(NewbieG) kurly, Sorry for that
(tdr) kurly, but i hear lynx is lightweight ... :)
(Terlisimo) with crypt on zfs I lose all benefits of using zfs in the first place, except the data integrity, which cryptfs provides anyway
(+kurly) tdr: so is netcat if you're good at reading HTML ;)
(Terlisimo) I think I'll just have to modify genkernel scripts and add support for something like crypt_root2. I was just wondering if this may already be supported somehow.

(tdr) NewbieG, its all about bragging rights and trusting upstream.

(HungGarRebel) NewbieG: slim sounds like what you're after
(NewbieG) tdr, can i set i3 as default in login manager??
(HungGarRebel) NewbieG: I believe slim or a login mananger is just a program that reads .xinitrc when you log in

(johnfg) got a problem/quirk with sound on this plasma system.
(Psyb3rN4ut) johnfg: ?
(+iamben) thomas_: probalby yes.  if you dont know which codec is used, enable all of them.  if SND_HDA_INTEL is built-in, make the codecs built-in too.  or make it all modular.  but dont mix.
(johnfg) sound works great, in and of itself.  but when I mute from the keyboard, hitting the designated key, it does mute, but hitting the key again, it doesn't unmute.
(johnfg) I have to go to alsamixer and hit m to unmute it.
** alextai_ has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
(johnfg) Any fix for this?  Is it a known issue?
(thomas_) iamben, thank you very much! i just recompile my kernel and test it! How do you know that stuff so "fast" ? ;)
(+iamben) thomas_: this is a pretty typical issue (missing codecs)
(jmbailey) sounds familiar, tried any combinations with the mute key? i.e ctrl+[mute] ?

(+perfinion) TotalOblivion: efibootmgr is what adds entries to your boot list. its pretty nice overall and not that difficult really
(+perfinion) TotalOblivion: but i'd say go with grub first until your machine is setup and working
** szorfein has joined #gentoo
(+perfinion) then add the stub stuff, if anything does weird you can always boot through grub
(+iamben) grub-install also uses efibootmgr, efibootmgr is the tool used to manipulate UEFI boot order/entries from within linux, in general
(+perfinion) then later you switch the stub one to the default
(+iamben) i find it a bit confusing that hte handbook describes efibootmgr as its own boot method =)
(+perfinion) oh yeah
(+perfinion) its really just using the same tool as everything else to add an entry to go directly without a separate bootloader
(+iamben) efibootmgr can be used to add/manipulate UEFI boot entries for any EFI app/image... grub, efistub kernels, refind, gummiboot/systemd-boot, whatever

(+iamben) also kinda cool, you can specify which boot item runs @ next reboot, to reboot straight into UEFI setup menu or another OS =)
(+iamben) TotalOblivion: the default now includes "efi-64 pc" but you can set that to NOT build/install pc aka BIOS support
(TotalOblivion) I added it just in case :P
(TotalOblivion) efibootmgr actually seems like a great tool
(TotalOblivion) And it's already included in grub:2 :O

** alphawarr1or has quit (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)

** Krennic has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
(+iamben) TotalOblivion: well you need a workaround, like i said.  since no other UEFI boot images have been configured, add the "--removable" option to grub-install, this will make it install to the EFI default image location, which your emulated EFI should find at first boot

(jerware) Can someone help me figure out which kernel module to select for the Creative Sound Blaster Audigy Fx?  https://us.creative.com/p/sound-blaster/sound-blaster-audigy-fx
(newgentoouser) Hey. So I got a WM up and running and pulse seems to be working, but I can only see a dummy output. I can see two cards in /proc/asound/cards

(TotalOblivion) thanks :)
(username234) iamben: just checked head.  They changed all: ... to 'all: $(PROGRAMS) $(TESTLIBS)', so a simple ebuild fix is to just remove lib/libft.so from makefile.in and regenerate.

(newgentoouser) if alsamixer can see the soundcards, does that rule out a missing kernel module?
(newgentoouser) It seems like if I select a sound card, it doesn't have any controls
(newgentoouser) So I assume it's a matter of drivers?
(+iamben) newgentoouser: mostly, but if it's an HD audio card, make sure it's not using a generic codec
(+iamben) alsamixer may only see the pulseaudio emulated card, depending on where you launch it from
** porfiriopaiz has joined #gentoo
** murkx has quit (Quit: WeeChat 1.4)
(Psyb3rN4ut) iamben: he said he sees the card from alsamixer and not pulse....could that still be a codec issue?
(tdr) newgentoouser, if you see the actual card vs the pule control, no channels = the wrong codec.  does f6 in your alsamixer list the card device?
(+iamben) Psyb3rN4ut: maybe yes
(newgentoouser) tdr: - (default), 0 HDA Intel PCH, 1 HDA Nvidia (the latter being HDMI)
** Josh_2 has joined #gentoo
(Psyb3rN4ut) newgentoouser: and if you choose the intel one....do you see channels?
(tdr) newgentoouser, ok its just a codec problem then
** loxaxs has joined #gentoo
(newgentoouser) Psyb3rN4ut: no, no controls
(Psyb3rN4ut) ^^
(newgentoouser) so I need to look u pthe proper module in the kernel?
(Psyb3rN4ut) newgentoouser: go enable all the codecs under inted HD audio
(Psyb3rN4ut) newgentoouser: once it works...you can see which gets used and remove the others....i suspect you have realtek though
(newgentoouser) Stupid question, but does codec mean driver? :P
(Psyb3rN4ut) newgentoouser: no
(Psyb3rN4ut) you have the driver
(+iamben) newgentoouser: it's a type of driver, they are suboptions under SND_HDA_INTEL
(Psyb3rN4ut) newgentoouser: just without the codec
(newgentoouser) Oh, okay

** alextai_ has quit (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)
(jerware) Yes you need to reboot if compiled in.
(+iamben) in general you can make things modular and load them without rebooting, but with snd-hda-intel you have to use all modules or all built-in... if snd-hda-intel is built-in, codecs need to be built-in and you'll need a reboot
(newgentoouser) Alright, thanks! Will reboot
(+iamben) if snd-hda-intel is already a module, you can add the new codecs as modules, then unload/reload snd-hda-intel
(Psyb3rN4ut) newgentoouser: so just enable the generic one, the realtek one, and for pulse you need to set "underneath" but not "in" HD-Audio --->  the Pre-allocated buffer to (2048)
(Psyb3rN4ut) newgentoouser: ^^

(SuperSeriousCat) Hey. Installed Gentoo on a VM now and just used genkernel. Use GPT for partitioning. And UUID's in fstab. Was I supposed to pass an argument in genkernel to activate that? The error I get is "Could not find block root device in UUID=<my ID from fstab>. Place specify another value:". Typing in /dev/sda3 dont work
(damke_) I see, I remember reading that somewhere, but can't seem to remember clearly atm
** concaveirc has joined #gentoo
(+iamben) SuperSeriousCat: the default config of genkernel may or may not be enough, depending on your VM type and what storage it emulates.
** newgentoouser has joined #gentoo
(newgentoouser) Sound is working! Thanks guys
(newgentoouser) =)
(damke_) do programs only have a dependency, or a dependency with a *specific* version?
(SuperSeriousCat) immibis, ESXi. Using VMware paravirtual
(+iamben) damke_: they depend on whatever they need.  some dependencies are unversioned, some require a minimum version, some require a certain series (like any 2.0.x allowed, not 2.1)
(+iamben) SuperSeriousCat: check "lspci -k" output from a working livecd to see what kind of drivers it was using for the storage
(SuperSeriousCat) iamben, changed it and it booted so guess Im missing a module. Thanks :)
(concaveirc) Hi, I have installed gentoo on my school computer (dell latitude 5480) before, but this time I cannot figure out how to get the trackpad (ALPS Glidepoint, I assume) to work.

(concaveirc) I will post the lsmod output in a bit
(+iamben) SuperSeriousCat: yeah a more generic storage type is more likely to work ootb.  i think vmware likes to emulate some fusion-spi thing?

** johnnyreb has quit (Quit: WeeChat 1.9-dev)
(NewbieG) thomas_' yes sorry i forgot to put the symbol "?"
(tdr) NewbieG, its possible to use several files within the directory, or you can make package.use be a flat file with all your lines in it
** leipie has joined #gentoo
(GeneralStupid) NewbieG: but a question mark dosnt make a question out of that sentence
(thomas_) No, portage does not care about different files. But just for your own overview i would suggest it
(tdr) NewbieG, its up to you how to sort it
** f4cl3y has quit (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)
(tdr) NewbieG, the downside to many files with lines for different packages is that you could potentially have flags set for the same package within multiple files
(NewbieG) tdr, how emerge know which use flag is for which application..... I actually wanted to know how portage work to get local use flag
(SuperSeriousCat) Isent it easier to have all in 1 file tho? Just cat grep it
(tdr) NewbieG, the lines go:  catagory/package flag1 flag2 flag3  .... so each line specifies the group and package name
** eki has joined #gentoo
(thomas_) SuperSeriousCat, but is it also possible to grep a whole directory?
(thomas_) I'm not sure right now...
(NewbieG) tdr, and portage searches all the files under the package.use irrespective of file names??
(tdr) NewbieG, what i said for potential for duplicates is you could get 2 files with the same package listed but conflicting flags, and only one of them would be used
(SuperSeriousCat) thomas_, ls :p
** Hell-Razor has joined #gentoo

(m712) anyone using steam here? does anyone know why steam forgets autologin passwords and then blocks shutdown when you try to shutdown via consolekit? if you try to shut down the pc with i.e. XFCE + consolekit while steam is running, steam will show a "shutting down..." window, and the computer won't shut down, you need to go through the menu again, and on the next start
(m712) startup*, it will ask for password
(tdr) NewbieG, for example, you could have a file name "file1" that says "app-shell/bash nls"  or you could name the file bash, the line would be found either way
(SuperSeriousCat) thomas_, probably easier to just use autocomplete. Unless there is magic I dont know about

(NewbieG) tdr, when conflict arises suppose i write two files but with completely opposite use flag i mean for example suppose in one file i use kde use flag for xyz application and in another file i use -kde for the same use flag then what will happen??

** galaxy_knuckles has joined #gentoo

** venom00ut has joined #gentoo
(NewbieG) tdr, what you mean by last line read
(NewbieG) Can you please explain little bit
(tdr) NewbieG, portage will read through all the files in the directory.  the last one read with a line for your application would be used.  probably goes albetically by file name
(tdr) alphabetically ..
(+iamben) multiple entries will be stacked, but specifications of the same flag will use the last match
(tdr) iamben, oh so non-conflicting flags are appended?
(tdr) thats a good thing
(+iamben) tdr: correct
(+iamben) eg you can do "sys-devel/gcc fortran -debug" then "sys-devel/gcc:6.4.0 debug" and you'll end up with all versions having fortran on, and only gcc-6.4.0 having debug on
** splinux has joined #gentoo
(NewbieG) tdr, so i guess it is much better to use one file for local use flag so that we will not have to remember previous use flags
(tdr) NewbieG, its your choice.
(+iamben) using one flat file can make it easier to spot duplicates that coudl be combined/collapsed

(+iamben) kisame: what did you add to package.use, and what makes you think it's not applying?
(+iamben) NewbieG: "emerge -pvO vlc" shows the already set values.
(kisame) when i emerge the package the flag is still there. and stuff like -printersupport -opengl
(TotalOblivion) Whenever I realize I need to make a change to the kernel I only re-compile it and everything works?

(tdr) TotalOblivion, so long as you enable what you need, sure
(+iamben) kisame: can you share "emerge -pvO PyQt5" output plus "grep -r PyQt5 /etc/portage" output?
(tdr) kisame, that means:  if webkit is enabled, printsupport must also be enabled
(newgentoouser) Maybe it's a bit off topic but are the defaults of cryptsetup fine? i.e. sha256 instead of sha512, and the different keysizes. What's the difference?
(NewbieG) iamben, i don't want to add any extra use flag....as i stated earlier that when I am trying to install vlc its says "The following USE changes are necessary to proceed....."

(NewbieG) iamben, because it is saying when I am trying to install vlc its says "The following USE changes are necessary to proceed....." and i used a solution listed in Gentoo wiki

(tdr) kisame, portage would know
(kisame) ok
(+iamben) TotalOblivion: i put my ESP at /boot, but im pretty familiar with both methods.
(TotalOblivion) Is there any actual different if ESP is udner /boot or /boot/efi?
(tdr) TotalOblivion, you get one extra directory name on one command
** Hydrar has joined #gentoo
** leat has joined #gentoo
(tdr) TotalOblivion, (when you are running grub-mkconfig to generate the bootloader configuration ... you tell it where the file goes)
(+iamben) TotalOblivion: just the --efi-directory option on grub-install
(TotalOblivion) so it's more useful if you want to have both an MBR and an EFI boot, in case EFI fails to get back to MBR, I presume
(tdr) TotalOblivion, or you just reboot with a cd and fix it, then it wont fail :)
(TotalOblivion) haha. That too tdr :P
(+iamben) putting the ESP at /boot keeps your kernels on the ESP so you can fall back to (or experiment with) efistub direct boot, for one thing
(+iamben) also i believe efi "boot managers" like refind will want your kernels on ESP
(tdr) TotalOblivion, once efi is setup, it doesn't randomly fail and its easy to work with
** ssmike has quit (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
(tdr) iamben, refind doesn't care unless you want it to autoscan for efi stubs
** buscher has joined #gentoo
(TotalOblivion) So the best practice in general is to just stick ESP to /boot and move onward with your life :P
** nomad__ has joined #gentoo
(tdr) TotalOblivion, if you already have a /boot partition made, its ok to use it tho
** ssmike has joined #gentoo
(tdr) TotalOblivion, its like most other fs choices, there are options and no one forces you to do many of them
(TotalOblivion) tdr, hold on. Aren't I supposed so create a ~256MiB /boot partition as vfat for UEFI? That's ESP. Unless I've made a mess of things in me head lol
** fefelix has joined #gentoo
(tdr) TotalOblivion, that vfat IS your EFI
(+iamben) whatever one you format as vfat, that's the ESP
(tdr) TotalOblivion, EFI = ESP
(TotalOblivion) ok.
(tdr) iamben, refind lets you specify a volume or UUID etc per menu entry, its flexible too.  it may even support UUID or device paths on the kernel loader lines
(+iamben) tdr: yeah i was only thinking about the autosearch functionality
** fekepp has quit (Remote host closed the connection)

** nomad__ has quit (Client Quit)
(+iamben) TotalOblivion: as long as you're only working from root user, it's fine to keep /home unmounted until first boot

(+iamben) for now just stick with defaults and dont fret it too much
(+iamben) it's a bit confusing on these in particular, but the majority of those codec-related flags on both ffmpeg & vlc only affect *encoding*, not playback
(tdr) NewbieG, no bluray needed?   v4l lets you use webcam, gnutls or openssl would let you do crypted connections/streams, lzma is a compression type, twolame lets you use multiple cores if you are "saving audio to mp3" , pulseaudio lets you switch between audio outputs easy etc.  ...

(kvoz) iamben, tells me its already running
(+iamben) kvoz: kill it and launch it again
(NewbieG) tdr, so basically if i set flag and pull that package again i mean (emerge -a packagename) it will not going to do the job???.... If yes then why
(kerframil) I would recommend dhcpcd -T in this situation. it's good for debugging.
(kerframil) also, make sure the link is in an "UP" state and not afflicted by "NO-CARRIER"
(kvoz) iamben, soliciting an ipv6 router, soliciting a dhcp lease, using ipv4all address 169.254.44.80
(tdr) NewbieG, you shouldnt use emerge -va package on every single pakcage tho.  calling them as a target to emerge adds them to world file.  if they are only deps, they should be done with --oneshot or -1
(JewishMonk) iamben - I am not 100% sure. I forgot to enable the rtl module during the initial kernal compile and I'm not positive that the kernal I'm currently using has that moduile enabled.
(Psyb3rN4ut) NewbieG: reemerge is rebuilding/compiling over the package
